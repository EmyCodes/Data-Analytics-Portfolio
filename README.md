## 📈 My "Practice to Perfection" Journey
I believe that a Data Analyst's greatest tool is the ability to present findings without bias. While I am constantly learning and refining my skills, I am committed to "learning in public." You can find my recent lessons on data integrity and process automation documented here and on my LinkedIn.
