# 📊 WordPoint Ministries: Digitized Workers Report (DWR) & Engagement Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project represents a full-cycle data solution—transitioning from a manual monitoring system developed during my Industrial Training (IT) to a modern, visual analytical dashboard. By revisiting a dataset of **92 responses** from **16 individuals** across **5 centers** in Osun State, I transformed "raw noise" into a strategic roadmap for leadership.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Data Collection:** Google Forms & Automated Google Sheets Pipeline.
* **Data Cleaning:** Excel (Validation, deduplication, and normalization).
* **Visualization:** Microsoft Excel (Funnel Charts, Dynamic Column/Line Charts, Pie Charts).
* **Methodology:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and Descriptive Analytics.

## 🔐 Data Governance & Security
* **Access Control:** Designed the original ecosystem with filtered access, ensuring fellowship leaders only viewed data relevant to their specific centers while administrators maintained a global view.
* **Information Masking:** Sensitive worker identifiers have been hidden to ensure privacy while maintaining the integrity of center-based analytics.
* **Workbook Protection:** All source sheets and the global workbook are password-protected to mimic enterprise-level data administrative security.

## 🚀 Key Features & Solutions
* **Manual to Digital Pivot:** Replaced manual submissions with a digitized ecosystem to ensure real-time data capture.
* **Automated Feedback Loop:** Built a pipeline where worker submissions immediately reflected in both leader and administrative dashboards.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensured all "raw noise" from the original DWR system was cleaned and validated before being processed by the dashboard.

## 📈 Strategic Insights Uncovered
* **High Engagement Hotspots:** Identified the **University of Ilesa** as the most active hub with **48 submissions**, followed by the **Headquarters** at 19.
* **Targeted Intervention:** Isolated centers with lower submission rates (**OscoTech**, **Esa-Oke**, and **UNIOSUN Ipetu-Ijesa**) to provide leadership with actionable data for follow-ups.
* **Individual Consistency:** Detected "data signals" for individual follow-up, such as identifying respondents with only a single submission despite high overall center activity.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap: The "Multi-Tool" Comparison
As part of my **IBM Data Analyst** journey, I will be running this same validated dataset through:
1. **IBM Cognos** (Advanced Enterprise Visualization).
2. **Google Looker Studio** (Cloud-based Dynamic Reporting).
